# 💼 Portfolio: Level-Up Phase Unlocked

After weeks of iteration, late-night design tweaks, and bug-hunting sprints, I'm hyped to say this: **my portfolio just hit a serious milestone**. It’s not perfect yet, but it’s solid — clean, responsive, and one step closer to a production-ready beast.

### ✅ Current Highlights:

- Built with **React + Tailwind CSS**
- **Responsive** across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Polished **project showcase** with dynamic routing
- Improved **performance** and load speed
- Set up structure for **admin panel**, **certificates page**, and **dark mode** (coming soon 👀)

It’s now more than a portfolio — it’s a living resume that tells the story of what I’ve built and where I’m going.

# 🧠 Next Step: NeetCode Pro Lifetime?

Now that the front-end grind is in a solid place, my brain's shifting to one word: **interviews**. And let’s be real — LeetCode is a battlefield. I'm seriously considering going all-in on **[NeetCode Pro Lifetime](https://neetcode.io)**.

### 💡 Why I’m Leaning In:

- Everything’s **structured** — no more guessing what topic to do next
- Includes **DSA, system design, OOP** & more — all in one ecosystem
- **Lifetime access** = no monthly fees, just long-term ROI
- I want to **grind smart, not random**

> 🧠 NeetCode isn’t just a resource. It’s a mindset shift. One-time buy. Long-term skill gain.

This is bigger than a pretty website or finishing a coding tutorial.

This is about:

The portfolio is my launchpad. NeetCode could be the jet fuel. Let’s see where this goes 🚀
