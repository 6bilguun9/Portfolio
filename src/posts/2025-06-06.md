## ðŸš€ Portfolio: Polished and Production-Ready

After weeks of refining, tweaking, and obsessing over pixels, I can finally say this â€” **my portfolio is polished and borderline production-ready**.

- Fully responsive across devices âœ…
- Clean UI/UX using Tailwind CSS and React âœ…
- Added project pages with dynamic routing âœ…
- Performance optimized for deploy âœ…
- Dark mode, admin panel, and a certificate page all live âœ…

Itâ€™s no longer just a project; itâ€™s a representation of my dev journey. I wanted it to reflect not just what Iâ€™ve done, but what I can do next.

## ðŸ¤” Whatâ€™s Next? NeetCode Pro Lifetime?

Now that my portfolioâ€™s in a good spot, Iâ€™m thinking about doubling down on interview prep. Iâ€™ve been grinding LeetCode here and there, but itâ€™s time to take it seriously. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m **considering buying the lifetime access to [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io)**.

### Why NeetCode?

- Everythingâ€™s in one place: data structures, algorithms, and even system design.
- Lifetime = no monthly BS. Just pay once, and itâ€™s mine.
- Clean UI and structured progress. No wasting time on what to learn next.
- Iâ€™m tired of scrolling Reddit for "best 75 LeetCode questions". NeetCode _is_ the path.

## ðŸ”¥ The Bigger Picture

Iâ€™m not just building projects to "look good." Iâ€™m playing long-term. This portfolio is just the front gate. Behind that gate, I want to build the skills, crack the interviews, land the roles, and eventually lead my own tech empire.

NeetCode Pro feels like a weapon â€” and Iâ€™m ready to wield it.

**Next Steps:**

- âœ… Deploy final version of portfolio
- âŒ› Decide on NeetCode lifetime (leaning 90% yes)
- ðŸ“ˆ Keep pushing on DS&A and AWS cert prep

Stay tuned. This is just the start.
