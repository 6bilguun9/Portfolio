# 🌐 Domain + Deployment

Today I launched my portfolio on a **custom domain**: `thebilguun.com`.  
I’ve been working on this for weeks, and now it's finally live and running through **Netlify**.

The setup involved a bit of DNS config — updating the nameservers and making sure my React routes don’t break on reload. Thankfully, Netlify's `_redirects` file handled that. Everything's smooth now.

> It’s a small win, but it feels like a real step forward.

### 🧠 Why I Bought NeetCode Pro Lifetime

I also decided to subscribe to **NeetCode Pro Lifetime**.  
Since I'm shifting more toward interview prep and DSA practice, it made sense to invest in a more structured system.

Here’s what stood out to me:

- -Clear path through DSA, system design, and OOP
- -No monthly fees — just long-term access
- -Fits well with my goal of preparing for internships and transfer apps

I’ve been using free resources for a while, but having everything in one place with guidance is going to help me stay consistent.

### 🛠 Portfolio Stack

Just for reference, the portfolio is built with:

- -React + Tailwind CSS
- -Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- -Dynamic routing for project pages
- -Clean dark mode design (more updates coming)

I also started planning out sections for **certificates** and an **admin panel**, which I’ll roll out later.

### 🧭 What’s Next

My focus now is on:

- -Practicing LeetCode daily using NeetCode
- -Improving my site and blog section as I learn
- -Building at least one new full-stack project over the summer

### Final Thoughts

It wasn’t a flashy day, but it was productive and meaningful.  
Got the domain, deployed something I’m proud of, and invested in myself with NeetCode.

Now the goal is to stay consistent and keep building — one step at a time.
