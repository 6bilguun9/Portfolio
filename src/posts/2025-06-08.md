# ðŸ§  Data Structures Grind â€” Day 1

Today I officially started my data structures & algorithms grind â€” itâ€™s about time. Iâ€™ve been working on a lot of web dev and real-world coding, but I know that if I wanna crush technical interviews and level up, I need to master the fundamentals.

## ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Using to Learn

### âœ… **[FreeCodeCampâ€™s Data Structures Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)**

An absolute banger. It walks through arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and everything in between â€” explained by a Google engineer. Super clear and beginner-friendly but goes deep too.

### âœ… **[NeetCode.io Patterns Course](https://neetcode.io/)**

Iâ€™m pairing the theory with problem-solving patterns from NeetCode â€” two birds, one stone. This helps me build **pattern recognition**, which is ðŸ”‘ for interviews. The plan is:

- Learn a concept
- Build it from scratch
- Then solve 2â€“3 LeetCode problems based on it

---

## ðŸ’» What I Built Today

I built my own **DynamicArray<T>** in Java â€” like an `ArrayList`, but from scratch and generic.

- âœ… Supports append, prepend, insert, remove, get, set
- âœ… Automatically resizes
- âœ… Works with any data type (`T`)
- âœ… Clean code, index-safe, and reusable

It might seem simple, but this is foundational stuff. I now understand memory allocation, resizing logic, and generic programming on a deeper level.

## ðŸ”¥ Next Goals

- Implement `LinkedList`, `Stack`, and `Queue` from scratch
- Keep solving LeetCode easy/medium problems on arrays and hashing
- Build pattern recognition muscle by the end of this week
- Hit at least 1 DS concept + 3 LeetCode problems a day

## ðŸ’¬ Why Iâ€™m Doing This

I want to be unstoppable technically â€” and that means mastering the grind. This isnâ€™t about school. This is about **becoming a better engineer**, one day at a time.

Letâ€™s run it up.  
**Day 1 complete.**
