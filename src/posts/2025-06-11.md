## Grinding Data Structures, One Node at a Time

Today I pushed a bit more progress into my **Singly Linked List** implementation. I’ve added several new methods that really start to make the structure feel complete — `addFirst()`, `addLast()`, `remove()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()`, and even worked on the iterator.

That said, still a few tiny things left to polish — like edge cases, null checks, and maybe optimizing some logic down the road. But honestly, it’s been cool seeing the codebase evolve. Every method added teaches me more about how these data structures work under the hood, which will definitely pay off in interviews and real-world projects.

## My New Weapon: Keychron Q2 Max 🔥

Aside from the coding grind, I made a small (but powerful) upgrade today — I copped the **Keychron Q2 Max** keyboard.

And let me tell you — I’m officially **in love**.

The typing feel is insane, super smooth, and lowkey makes writing code way more fun. The sound, the tactile feedback, the build quality — everything screams _premium_.  
Honestly feels like I'm investing into my workflow. These little quality-of-life upgrades compound over time and make the long coding sessions way more enjoyable.

## TLDR Summary:

- ✅ Added more methods to my singly linked list
- 🔜 Still have a few small things to finish
- ⌨️ Bought Keychron Q2 Max and it's a game-changer

> The grind continues — one line of code at a time.
