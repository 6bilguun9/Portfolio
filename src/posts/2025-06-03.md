title: "Leveled Up My Algorithms: Bucket Sort, Binary Search, and More LeetCode"

Today was a normal dayâ€”LeetCode grind + gym. I focused on Binary Search and Bucket Sort, making progress on my NeetCode course. Today I have finished 15 topics out of 35.

**What I Worked On**

- About **bucket sort**â€”it feels kind of useless unless the uniqueness of the elements is finite.
- Revisited **binary search**; I learned binary search about 3 months ago and I thought it was a good time to recall.
- Completed **2 medium LeetCode problems** that challenged me to combine sorting with searching techniques.
- Knocked out **1 easy LeetCode problem** to build momentum and keep my confidence high.

**Why This Matters**
After finishing my course, these algorithms will definitely help my LeetCode grind. From tomorrow, I will continue to work on my data structures project. I am trying to write all data structures and make one big system.

**Challenge + Insight**
I noticed that when I rushed into coding binary search, I tended to miscalculate the midpoint or mess up the loop boundaries. Slowing down to sketch out the index ranges on paper helped me spot bugs earlier. Sometimes the most practical move is to step back instead of brute-forcing a solution.

For life-wise goals, I want to increase my productivity more. I need to schedule my time better. Today I only sat at my desk for 3 hours. I want to bump that number to at least 6 hours. 2 hours of gym + 8 hours of productivity + 3 hours for eating + 8 hours of sleep + 1 hour for my morning schedule + 2 hours of free time.

About my morning schedule, I started doing meditation.

**Whatâ€™s Next**
Tomorrow, I plan to:

- Binary Search (search range)
- Binary Tree
- DFS
- Keep refining my mental models so these algorithms feel second nature.

Feeling accomplished and ready to double down again tomorrow. ðŸš€
