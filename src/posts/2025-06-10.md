### Progress Update - Day 2

Today I continued my data structures grind by diving into **Linked Lists**. I'm following both the [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM) and NeetCode to build a strong foundation and sharpen my pattern recognition skills.

I haven’t fully wrapped up Linked Lists yet, but the plan is to complete them along with **Stacks** tomorrow. I'm deliberately focusing on writing clean and maintainable code while following proper **Java conventions** — naming, structure, formatting — building solid habits that will scale with more advanced topics.

Even though it's taking a bit more time upfront, I know that developing clean coding practices now will make everything down the road much smoother — especially when solving harder problems or writing production-level code.

**Tomorrow's plan:**

- ✅ Finish Linked Lists
- ✅ Start and finish Stacks

Consistency over speed. Brick by brick.
