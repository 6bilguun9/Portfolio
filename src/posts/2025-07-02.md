title: "Crushed My First LeetCode Hard Problem: Merge K Sorted Lists"

Today was a milestone move in my coding journey: I finally solved my **first LeetCode Hard problem**â€”the infamous _Merge K Sorted Lists_ ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥

**What I Worked On**
I implemented a divide-and-conquer approach that basically leverages merge sort logic.

- Broke the array of linked lists into halves recursively.
- Merged pairs step by step into a single sorted list.
- Used a dummy node strategy to streamline linking.

The most satisfying part? Watching the recursion stack collapse into a clean, sorted linked list. It felt like _unlocking a cheat code_ for working with complex data structures.

**Why This Matters**
This wasnâ€™t just about solving a random hard problem to flex. Tackling this algorithm did three crucial things:

- Boosted my confidence to take on more advanced LeetCode challenges ðŸš€
- Sharpened my understanding of how recursion and linked lists can be combined effectively.
- Proved to myself that I can dissect high-difficulty problems and _ship results_, not just get stuck.

**Challenge + Personal Insight**
Honestly, I struggled at first with keeping track of all the recursive calls and merge steps. It was like juggling flaming swords. But once I broke it down step by stepâ€”visualizing the merge process in my headâ€”I started seeing the bigger picture.  
Key takeaway: **never let the problem intimidate you more than it deserves.** Stay systematic and keep iterating.

**Whatâ€™s Next**
Iâ€™m planning to line up a few more hard problems related to heaps and dynamic programming to keep this momentum rolling. This is a long game, and today was just a power-up.

Canâ€™t wait to see what Iâ€™ll unlock next. Letâ€™s keep shipping ðŸ’ªâœ¨
