title: "Crushed My First LeetCode Hard Problem: Merge K Sorted Lists"

Today was a milestone move in my coding journey: I finally solved my **first LeetCode Hard problem**â€”the infamous _Merge K Sorted Lists_ ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥

**What I Worked On**
I implemented a divide-and-conquer approach that leverages merge sort principles:

- Broke the array of linked lists into halves recursively.
- Merged pairs step by step into a single sorted list.
- Used a dummy node to simplify linking logic.

The most satisfying part was watching the recursion stack unwind into a clean, sorted linked list. It made the whole process feel manageable once I broke it down.

I also learned **Quick Sort** today. Seeing how partitioning and in-place swaps can efficiently sort an array gave me a clearer picture of different sorting strategies and when to apply them.

**Why This Matters**
This wasnâ€™t just about checking off a hard problem. Working through it did a few important things:

- Built my confidence to tackle more advanced LeetCode challenges.
- Strengthened my understanding of how recursion works with linked lists and arrays.
- Showed me that with patience and a systematic approach, even high-difficulty problems are approachable.

**Challenge + Personal Insight**
At first, I struggled to keep track of all the recursive calls and merge steps. It felt like trying to solve a puzzle without the picture on the box. But once I visualized each phase and stepped through the logic slowly, it clicked.  
The main takeaway: **problems only look intimidating until you start breaking them apart**. Consistent effort compounds over time.

**Whatâ€™s Next**
Iâ€™m planning to work on more hard problems involving heaps and dynamic programming to keep this momentum going. This is a long game, and today was a solid step forward.

Excited to see what Iâ€™ll learn next. Letâ€™s keep building.
