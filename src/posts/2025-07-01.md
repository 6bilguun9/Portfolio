title: "Deep Dive Into Insertion Sort and Merge Sort: Recursion Just Clicked"

Today was a solid grind session. I dedicated a big chunk of my focus to learning and implementing **insertion sort** and **merge sort**.

Insertion sort was straightforward in concept—basically building up a sorted list one element at a time by shuffling elements around as needed. But what really captured my attention was merge sort. The recursive approach felt elegant and almost hypnotic. Watching the array split into smaller subarrays, then get merged back in sorted order, made the whole process feel like solving a puzzle. Recursion has always seemed a bit abstract to me, but today it clicked in a very real way.

I’m working through the NeetCode course as part of my personal growth strategy and to keep my skills razor-sharp. It feels motivating to see these foundational algorithms finally make intuitive sense instead of just being something I memorized for an exam.

What stood out most was how merge sort leverages **divide and conquer** in such a clean, predictable fashion. That predictability is exactly what makes it powerful in large-scale applications. It’s the kind of approach I want to internalize so I can apply it instinctively when designing solutions in interviews or real-world systems.

**Challenge & Insight**

One challenge today was debugging my first implementation of merge sort recursion—I kept getting off-by-one errors in my index ranges. But instead of getting frustrated, I stepped back, walked through the logic on paper, and saw exactly where I was overshooting. That small breakthrough felt huge. It reminded me how important it is to slow down and trust the process.

**What’s Next**

I’m planning to keep building on this momentum by tackling quicksort next. It’s another divide and conquer strategy, but with a different flavor. My goal is to finish the sorting algorithms module by the end of this week and keep iterating through NeetCode daily.

Staying consistent is non-negotiable. The grind continues.
