## Standing next to my Ferrari to remind it that Iâ€™m coming for it once this Stack section is done.

Whatâ€™s up, dev fam? Just touched down from my New York trip, and let me tell you â€” that city doesnâ€™t sleep, and apparently, neither do I when it comes to the grind. While NYC gave me the energy boost I didnâ€™t know I needed, I came back hungrier than ever to conquer my roadmap, and Iâ€™ve got a major win to report:

> ðŸš€ **Stack Section: Completed. Mastered. Dominated.**

## ðŸ§± Built My Own Stack from Scratch

First off, I built my own stack data structure in Java using a singly linked list.  
No shortcuts, no pre-built libs â€” just raw logic, edge case handling, and that sweet, clean syntax.  
Push, pop, peek, and all the essentials are in the bag now. Itâ€™s not just theory anymore â€” itâ€™s muscle memory.

## ðŸ§  LeetCode Reps Done

Then I hit LeetCode and started smashing stack problems.  
From basic `Valid Parentheses` to trickier `Monotonic Stack` patterns â€” I was on fire.  
The kind of fire that doesnâ€™t burn out, 'cause once the pattern clicked, it was like seeing the matrix. ðŸ§©

## ðŸ“º NeetCode Stack Playlist: Checked Off

And of course, shoutout to **NeetCode** â€” the real MVP.  
I went through every single video in the stack section on YouTube.  
His explanations hit different, especially after doing the code myself first.  
Itâ€™s like hearing the same song after learning the lyrics â€” everything made 10x more sense.

## ðŸ’­ Reflection

Crazy how just a week ago I was navigating subway lines, late-night halal carts, and soaking in the city lights...  
and now Iâ€™m here navigating stack traces and pointer logic.  
The switch-up is real â€” but it feels _right_.  
This is how I want my life to go: **live a little, grind a lot, and level up always**.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m rolling straight into **Queues** and **HashMaps** next.  
Gotta keep the momentum going.  
Iâ€™m trying to get cracked before the next semester hits â€” internship applications donâ€™t wait, and neither will I.

If youâ€™re on the same path â€” building your CS foundation, juggling travel, and trying to become undeniable â€”  
letâ€™s keep each other accountable.

**Letâ€™s get this bag. Letâ€™s build this brain. And letâ€™s stack Wâ€™s.**
