Today I crossed off two big winsâ€”one in the codebase, and one in the gym.

## ðŸ§  Tech Update: Queue Conquered

Wrapped up the **Queue** section from **NeetCode**. I went deep on itâ€”not just watching tutorials but actually building my own queue from scratch using a **doubly linked list**. Fully O(1) on all main ops, iterable, and clean.

Also solved **two LeetCode problems** focused on queues. One of them involved simulating students taking sandwiches (brutal if you donâ€™t handle the loop right), and the other tested my queue logic under manipulation. Crushed both.

## ðŸ’ª Gym Update: The Bulk Is Bulking

My gym progress is looking solid lately. Been locking in nutrition, recovery, and consistency. My lifts are steadily going up and Iâ€™m starting to feel way more explosive in every session.

Noticed better muscle definition and strength all around. It's like Iâ€™m finally syncing my physical and mental disciplineâ€”one rep, one commit, one win at a time.

## Next Up

- **Stacks** are next on the NeetCode roadmapâ€”already planning to handcraft my own stack implementation.
- In the gym, gonna push a bit more volume and see how my body responds. Might experiment with push/pull splits soon.

Staying locked in, in both code and the gym. Letâ€™s ride.
